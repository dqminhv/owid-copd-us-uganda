OWID - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in The US and Uganda
==============

This work book calculates the crude death rate and age-standardized death rate from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the United States and Uganda in 2019. To obtain the results, the following steps are taken.

# Data collection
* **Age-specific death rates from COPD for both the United States and Uganda in 2019:** Provided by Our World in Data.
* **Age-standardized population:** Obtain from WHO Standard Population — Table 1 in 'Ahmad OB, Boschi-Pinto C, Lopez AD, Murray CJ, Lozano R, Inoue M (2001). Age standardization of rates: a new WHO standard.'
* **United States and Uganda population in 2019 in 5-year age groups:** Obtained from UN World Population Prospects (2022) — Population Estimates 1950-2021
# Formula
> Pi: Population of age group I
> 
> Di: Death rate from COPD of age group I
> 
> APi: Age-standardized population of age group i
## a. Crude death rate by COPD

* General formula: **Total death by COPD / Total population**

* Total death by COPD is calculated by **SUM(Di * Pi) / SUM(Pi)**

## b. Age-standardized death rate by COPD

* General formula: **Total death by COPD / Total population**

* Age-standardized death rate by COPD is calculated by **SUM(Di * SUM(Pi) * APi) / SUM(Pi)**

# Result
* **Crude death rate** for COPD of the **US** in 2019 is **56.9** per 100,000
* **Crude death rate** for COPD of **Uganda** in 2019 is **5.8** per 100,000
* **Age-standardized death rate** for COPD of the **US** in 2019 is **28.4** per 100,000
* **Age-standardized death rate** for COPD of **Uganda** in 2019 is **28.7** per 100,000
